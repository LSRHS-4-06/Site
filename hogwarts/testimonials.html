        <p>These are some of the most popular attractions at Hogwarts!
          <ul>
          <li>We visited Hogwarts and it was so much fun! We visited the Three Broomsticks and we even got lost on the staircase! I think that it was a very successful trip! -- Carrie, 38</li>
          <br>
          <li>I was not a fan of the Harry Potter series until I visited in person. Now I am the biggest fan! I even read the books while I was there and it was an incredible experience. I think the highlight was visiting the Chamber of Secrets (without the giant snake, of course). -- Anthony, 41</li>
          <br>
          <li>This has been my favorite vacation yet! Harry Potter was a huge influence on me when I was a kid and to be able to walk those halls has been really great! I know that I will bring my kids here later! -- Lara, 29</li>
