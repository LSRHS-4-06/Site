        <p> There are many ways to get to Hogwarts, the most popular being by train. It is true that there is a Platform 9 3/4, and you will have to go through it the same way as Harry did! Each ticket costs 20 pounds and you will have to go to the special booth located at King's Cross Station(Euston Road, London, Greater London N1 9AL, UK). The directions will be on the back of the ticket!
        Another special edition way is the flying car! This is a more expensive adventure and you will land closer to the Womping Willow than you will appreciate, but it is worth the memory! This costs 30 pounds, and there are only a limited amount of cars to take! </p>
