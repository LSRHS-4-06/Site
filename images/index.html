    <tr>
      <td><img src="giphy.gif" width="400px"/></td>
      <td>This is a gif taken from the internet has a pixel size of 480 x 261. It is 2.1 MB (Giphy.com). Gifs are better for animations rather than real life pictures because there are only 256 colors you can use.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="drawing.png" width="400px"/></td>
      <td> This is a drawing of a tree and a sun from photoshop. It has a pixel size of 600 x 800 and it is 56.6 Kbps (Photoshop). I saved it as a png-8. A png-8 is the same simple type of file as a gif except sometimes it can be a smaller file with a good quality. A PNG-24 is very good quality image. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="narnia.jpg" width="400px"/></td>
      <td> This is a photo that I took of a sign. It is a JPG that has a pixel size of 480 x 640 and it is 900KB. JPGs allow a lot more colors and effects that come with regular pictures like gradients and highlights. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="fruitbowl.png" width="400px"/></td>
      <td> This is a photo I got from the internet and changed in photoshop (RecipeLand.com). I cropped the photo and contrasted the fruitbowl with the background. I increased the exposure and brightness and I added a blur to the background so the fruitbowl would stand out. The image size is 1.91 MB and the pixel size is 895 x 747. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="preeya.png" width="400px"/></td>
      <td> This is a 3D text of my name that I made on photoshop. It is in 3D format. It is 800 x 1000 pixels and it has a size of 2.29 Megabytes. I saved it in the form of a png-8 because it does not need the wide range that a png-24 needs (photoshop).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="americanflag.jpg" width="400px"/></td>
      <td> This is my one other photo. It is of an American flag and it is 304 x 171 pixels. It is a jpg that is the size of 156 kilobytes.(glennbeck.com)
