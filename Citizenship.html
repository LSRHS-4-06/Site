    <h1><center>What is Citizenship to Me?</center></h1>
    <p><center>Citizenship: the state of being vested with the rights, priviledges, and duties of a citizen.</center></p>

    <h2><center>Components of Good Citizenship</center></h2>
    <p><center>Honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, courage, and tolerance are all parts of being a good citizen.</center>
      <br>
    <p>Honesty is the fairness and straightforwardness of conduct. Honesty is necessary because in order to show respect for your country, people must not lie to their fellow citizens or nation.</p>
    <p>Compassion is sympathetic awareness of others' distress combined with a desire to make them better. Compassion is necessary because it is what drives people to help each other and therefore help one's country.</p>
    <p>Respect is high or special regard. People must respect their country because it is what drives them to follow the rules and be nice to others.</p>
    <p>Responsibility is moral, legal, or mental accountability. Responsibility is necessary for good citizenship because you must be accountable for every action you take, and you must be responsible for upholding the laws of society.</p>
    <p>Courage is mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty. Courage is necessary in order to fight for your country, whether it be physically or otherwise. </p>
    <p><b>Tolerance is sympathy or indulgence for beliefs or practices differing from or conflicting with one's own. Tolerance is necessary because people must be aware of different points of view in order to get along and keep peace within a country.</b></p>
    <h3><center>Act of Citizenship</center></h3>
    <p>A good act of citizenship would be helping people recover after Hurrican Harvey hit Texas. A lot of people travelled from all over the world to help people living in Texas get back on their feet. They showed compassion for those in distress, respect for their lives and well-being, courage to go towards the disaster in order to help those less-fortunate than themselves, and other qualities that make them a great citizen.</p>
