        <td>Blair felt herself getting really cold. Then, she saw a figure in the distance and flew closer. It was a penguin!
        “Can you help me catch the sun?” she asked.
        “Why would I need to?” he asked. “The sun comes around for a really long time up here. I have a lot of sun here. I doesn’t matter anyway, though. It’s still freezing up here.”
        Blair was getting very cold, so she decided to fly away.
