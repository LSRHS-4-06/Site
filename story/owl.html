        <td>It was getting dark, and Blair saw a tree to rest in. However, when she got there, she found that it was already occupied by an owl.
          “Can you help me catch the sun?” she asked.
          The owl looked at her calmly and said, “The sun is not something you can catch.”
          Blair looked at him in surprise. “Really?” she asked.
          “Yes, the sun is far away and it is beyond our control,” the owl said.
          Blair started to cry. She hated the darkness, and now there  was no solution…
