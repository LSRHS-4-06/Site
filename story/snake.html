        <td>Blair flew and flew until she reached the desert. She saw a snake slithering along and went to go ask him if he knew how to catch the sun.
        “My name isss Ssssseth,” the snake called Seth said. “Why do you want to catch the ssssun? It isss sssso hot all the time, it’sss nice to get a break! Pleassse don’t catch the sssun! I love the nighttime.”
        Blair knew Seth was not going to help her, so she took her things and flew away.
          <p> Where does she go next? </p>
