        <td>Blair found a giraffe some time later.
          “Hi,” she said. “Can you help me catch the sun?”
          The giraffe turned and blinked at her.
          “I really want to, but I am too afraid of leaving home. I am afraid of other worlds, and I don’t think I will survive.”
          Blair nodded in understanding, and flew away.
