        <td>Brady saw a horse drinking water in the fields and went to go ask her if it knew how to catch the sun.
          “Can you help me catch the sun?” she asked.
          The horse looked up from the water and said, “No, I will not. I am tired, you see. I have been riding all day and that seems like a lot of work.”
          The horse returned to her water and Blair flew away.
