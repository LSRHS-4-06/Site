        <td>Brady the bird was afraid of the dark. The immensity of the blackness made him fearful of everything that could be so close to him. Every day when the sun set, he felt this pang of fear that he was in danger.
        Then one day, Brady had a brilliant idea. “I don’t ever have to say goodbye to the sun! I will just catch it!”
        So Brady packed his things and went on a journey.
          <p> Where does he go next? </p>
