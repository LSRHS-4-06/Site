        <td>Blair flew high and low, until she came across the majestic ocean. She saw a dolphin swimming in the waves and flew over to him.
        “Hi! I am trying to catch the sun, can you help me?” she asked.
        “I would love to! I love the sun too! But I live underneath the waves, so I cannot help you in your search. Good luck!” he said.
        So Blair flew away.
